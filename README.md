# Validation-part-of-piano-simulation-model
This is the validation part of the virtual pianos simulation model
## Part1: Change the number of points/string, space step (J values)
In this part, we present the validation of a piano string simulation model by varying the spatial resolution (J values). The goal is to determine the optimal balance between simulation accuracy and computational efficiency.
## Part2: Validation of Piano String Simulation Model with Recorded Piano Sound
In this second part, we validate our piano string simulation model (main melody instead of the chord) by comparing the synthesized sound generated by the model with a recorded piano sound. Since we created the recording mannully, we need to use code to make the rcording have the same satring point and duration.
