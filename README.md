## Introduction 
* Throughout human history, music has been a ubiquitous presence in cultures worldwide, transcending lan guage and geographic barriers. While there is significant variation in the structure and meaning of music across cultures, certain fundamental elements such as pitch, rhythm, and harmony are universal. Achieving a pleasing musical composition can be a challenging task that requires a careful alignment of musical notes. This is especially true when creating a piano composition, which involves the interplay of multiple notes and requires a precise understanding of the underlying physics. 
* To create a virtual piano, we will use the real-world physics of second-order wave equations.1 This will allow us to simulate the behavior of the strings in response to a hammer strike and produce a range of notes with varying pitch and quality. We will also provide functions that are applicable to the round and chord in the sheet music, which are essential elements of many musical compositions. 
To illustrate the practical applications of these functions and the virtual piano, we will construct a song - the Ode to Joy. This song is
